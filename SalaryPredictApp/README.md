## Deploying a ML model using Flask as an API
In this project we are simply going to train a simple Linear Regression for salary prediction using scikit-learn and then create a flask web app.  

In this repo there will be three files :  
1. model.py : We are gonna develop and train our model.
2. server.py : We will code to handle POST requests and return the results.
3. request.py : and Finally, we will send the requests with the features with the server and recieve the results.


### Let's Try

`git clone https://github.com/imSrbh/DeployML-Flask`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
